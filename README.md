# Gamedev Course - Tutorial 7

What i've done:
 - Differentiate between Mesh and Collision
   - Mesh is just a skin for the object
 - For 3D, there is additional z. What i remembered is y is vertical.
 - Using raycast for interaction. Raycast is just a line in front of the player. Simulating a hand
 - Rotate camera and raycast together for simulating and rotating head and its hand
 - Interactable object. Light and collectible.
 - This is the most interesting, creating object using CSG. Level and simple object.
 - Add simple sprint and crouch
 - Collectible part only make the number increase. Not like an inventory yet
